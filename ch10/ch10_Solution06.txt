Q: Sort a Big file about 20G with one string per line.

Answer: 
We use external sort. Because the file is 20 G large that we cannot put them in memory.
To speed the sort, we could divide the file into chunks , such as Y megabytes. Y is the amount of memory 
available. Then we sorting them respectively, and save them back into the file system.

When all chunks are sorted, we merge these sorted chunks one by one and we can get the fully sorted file.
