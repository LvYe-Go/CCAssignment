100 Lockers:
We give the number of locker from 1 to 100.

The left locker num should have been been toggled for odd times. 
That means the num should have odd number of factors. 
From knowledge of math that we know the square number like 

36 = (1 * 36) = (4 * 9) = (2 * 18) = (3 * 12) = （6 * 6） have odd pairs. 

So, there are 10 sqaure number in range from 1 to 100.

There are 10 lockers are open.
