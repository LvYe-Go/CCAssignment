sAnts:

(1) We can consider the possibility that they will not have collision. 
    The first ant can pick whichever direction but the rest of two ant must be the same direction of the first one. So, #2 ant ,and #3 ant have two directions to choose respectively. So there are (1/2) * (1/2) possibility that they can stay harmony. 

    So the collision happens possibility is : 
            1 -  (1/2)* (1/2) = 3/4;



(2) Follow Up:  If have n ants and n-vertex polygon.
    Same method,  thinking from not conflicts. 
    #1 can choose whatever direction, the following n-1 ants must the same direction as the first one. 
    There are (1/2) ^ (n-1) possibility without collision. 
    And the collision possibility is :
             1 - (1/2) ^ (n-1);
