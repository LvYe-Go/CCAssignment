Jugs of Water:

Q = Quart  here
big one = 5Q jug
small one = 3Q jug


(1) Pull over to full into big one .
(2) Pull over from big one into small one becomes full (use 3Q), and 2Q left in big one.
(3) Empty the small one.
(4) Pull over the left 2Q from big one into small one. So big one is empty and small one has 2Q left. 
(4) Make big one full.
(5) Pull 1Q into small on still small one is full. Then this time 4Q is left in the big one 

Made it!
