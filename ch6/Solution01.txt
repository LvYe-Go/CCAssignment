The Heavy Pills:
We can take different number of pills from different bottles. 
Take one pill from 1# bottle, two pills from #2 bottle... so on take 19 pills from #19 bottle.

If they are all 1.0 gram , the total wieght should be 
(1 + 2 + 3 + ... 20) = 210 grams.

But one of them from bottle #N has make the result heavier than 210 grams. 

The bottle number should be : 

(weight - 210)/0.1 . E.g, the total weight is 210.7, the heavier bottle is #7.
