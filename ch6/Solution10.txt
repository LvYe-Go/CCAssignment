Find posion bottle: 

We can take the 10 strips as the binary presentation of bottles. 

We can num the bottle  from 1 to 1000. 

The #1 bottle pull on the first strip.  (01)
The #2 bottle pull on the second strip.  (10)
Teh #3 bottle pull on the frist and second  strip. (11)
...
And so on.

The after seven days , we can know which of the bottle is posion be just use the presentation by bianry of strips. If #1, #2, #4 strips are positive , then the 1011 => #13 bottle is posion.
